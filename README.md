# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

My name is Brian Enigma. I write a lot of C/C++ and Python code. Although my training has been in embedded systems, my day job for the last decade+ has been video encoding and captions. My GitHub repos are primarily side projects â€” lots of Maker projects that usually involve laser cutting, 3D printing, and microcontrollers. Also in my spare time I help run [Puzzled Pint](http://www.puzzledpint.com), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that produces monthly puzzle events at local bars and pubs around the world.
